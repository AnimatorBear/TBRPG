Welcome to my Text Based RPG!

.exe is under tbrpgv2/bin/debug/net6.0.tbrpgv2.exe

Shortcuts dont want to work for some reason

The map and encounters and stuff are very rushed. 
I realized a bit too late that the deadline was the 26th of january.

This is also why you just start with a skill reroll potion and an enchanted chair.
I was planning to add a shop where you could buy these instead.

Dying is also not really a feature, Currently it just puts an L where the enemy you died to is.

Currently Charger and Tank are missing class specific attacks.
